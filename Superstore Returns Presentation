Superstore Returns Presentation

Overview
This project analyzes the high number of users returns, identifies possible root causes of returns, and offers suggestions/recommendations for sales growth.
                
Assumptions About the Data
Customers with less than 1 order or less were rejected for this study


Functionality

* You can view the story/presentation on Tableau by pressing on the tabs - story starts from left to right.
* You can hover over the line graph to show the return by month. The floating filter allows for the year to be isolated or combined. By default, we view the return rate by all the years collectively. Sheet 2.5.
* You can hover over the map to show return rate by state, starting with the highest to lowest. The floating filter allows the end user to filter by Region. By default, we view the return rate by (All) Regions. Sheet 2.4.
* You can hover over the scatterplot to be shown total sales ($) and return count per sub-category. Sheet 2.1.

Recommendations/Suggestions:

* Consider restocking less Papers and Binders in all Regions for the upcoming year.
* Offer more seasonal discounts or promotions - customers are less likely to return cheaper items if it requires the same amount of effort compared to more expensive products.
* Refocus marketing efforts to other Regions outside of West. For example, the average return rate for Central Region is significantly lower than the West, which could mean not a lot of product options for customers to choose from.

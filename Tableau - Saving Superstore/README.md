# Data Visualization with Tableau

# Saving SuperStore


## Description of the Project:
This project examines profit growth and losses, recommending products to retain or delist based on consumer profit and return data.


For each question, we will prepare an individual visualization:
1. Profits & losses.
Initially, we aim to pinpoint the significant profit and loss centers within the superstore.
- Among the pairs of dimensions (e.g., subcategory + region, or shipping mode + product ID) what are the two primary profit centers and the two major contributors to losses?
- Which products should the superstore stop selling? 
Which product subcategories should the store prioritize, and which ones should they discontinue? Select three of each.

2. Advertising:
The Superstore is checking if advertising makes sense. It should work well over time and in different places, and the profit per item sold should be high enough to make it worthwhile.
- We'll pinpoint the top three combinations of states and months of the year for effective advertising. 
- We'll create a visualization illustrating the average profit for each month of the year in those three states. Based on the return on ad spend ratio, we'll determine how much we'd be willing to invest in advertising. For this exercise, the willingness to spend on advertising is set at 1/5 of the profits.

3. Returned items
We'll explore if certain products have higher-than-normal return rates to the store.
- What products experience the highest return rates?
- Who are the customers with the highest return rates?
- We'll create a visualization showcasing the average profit versus the average return rate by category. This visual representation will make a compelling case for either retaining or discontinuing business based on this dimension.
## Project Goal:
The main objective of this project is to utilize Tableau's data visualization capabilities to analyze the SuperStore's profitability and facilitate informed decision-making. Our focus includes identifying profit centers, pinpointing loss-makers, exploring advertising opportunities, and investigating product return rates to discern contributing products and customers.
## Tools and Libraries:
- Tableau: Utilize Tableau for data visualization and analysis.

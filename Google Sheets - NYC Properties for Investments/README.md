# NYC Properties for Investments


### Description of the Problem:
The project task was determining which properties are good investments for the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City.
The client seeks help in prioritizing their research by answering the following questions:
- Which type of properties should we consider?
- For vacation rentals, which neighborhoods hold the most appeal?
- What size properties (i.e., how many bedrooms) garner the most popularity for vacation rentals?
- What is the average occupancy for each listing?
- Which days of the week exhibit the highest occupancy rates?
- Estimate the revenue for an investment property.
- What attributes are significant for a vacation rental (e.g., property perks)?

### Project Goal:
The main objective of this project is to deliver data-driven insights and recommendations to empower our client to make well-informed decisions regarding their investments in Manhattan vacation rental properties. Through addressing key questions and conducting a comprehensive analysis of Airbnb data, our goal is to provide strategic guidance, optimize the client's return on investment, and ensure the success of their investments.

# NYC Properties for Investments Projects

## Overview
* The following analysis is to determine which properties are good investments for the vacation rental market in the Manhattan borough of New York City

### Assumptions About the Data

1. Minimum nights requirements were reduced to less than 7. Beyond 7 nights were not.
2. Used number of reviews per a 12 month period to estimate how often a listing is rented
3. Listings with no reviews from the last 12 months are most likely inactive, so they were not considered

### Functionality

* You can view the Listings Processed tab to view filtered and sorted listing data
* You can view the Calendar Processed tab to view filtered and sorted calendar data
* Pivot Table 1 shows the number of reviews for the top 10 Manhattan neighborhoods, sorted from high to low
* Pivot Table 2 shows the number of reviews per bedroom for the top 10 Manhattan neighborhoods
* Pivot Table 3 shows the average of reviews per listing ID

### Recommendations

The Lower East Side neighborhood is a good neighborhood to invest in as it generates a good return on investment

### Technologies 
* To filer, format, and analyze data Google Sheets was used

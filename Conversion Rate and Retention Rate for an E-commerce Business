Conversion Rate and Retention Rate for an E-commerce Business

Overview
Used data to construct a conversion funnel to understand how well the website converts product page views into purchases.

Acquisition cohorts were built based on the month of a userâ€™s first purchase for 5 months to track cohort metrics month by month.

Results of the Data

1. Total conversion rate (TCR) for purchases made is 36%, TCR for users to shopping page stage is 29%, and TCR for shopping page to purchase stage is 10%
2. Retention rate is higher for the first week of each month reflected by the cohort age column


Functionality

* You can view the Table of Contents tab to view the contents of each sheet and with a short description
* You can view the Executive Summary tab to view the results of the detailed analysis
* Pivot Table 1 (conversion_funnel) shows the total conversion rate for users in each funnel stage 
* Pivot Table 2 (first_purchase) shows the first purchase date of every user, need for the first_purchase month column on purchase_activity sheet
* Pivot Table 3 (cohort_age) shows the formed cohorts by age of each user transaction within a month for 5 months.
* Pivot Table 4 (retention_rates) shows the calculated starting cohort size for each week; divided the cohort_age by unique user_id to get retention rates

Technologies 
To filter, format, and analyze data, Google Sheets was used

# Conversion Rate and Retention Rate (Business Analytics)


### Description of the Problem:
As a consultant, the company and executive team seek to comprehend the user purchasing behavior on the website. We aim to track user purchase activity from their initial to final purchase, organizing them into cohorts by month. Subsequently, we will calculate the retention rates for each cohort on a month-by-month basis.

The company seeks help in prioritizing their research by answering the following questions:
- How are users interacting with the website?
- How does user purchasing behavior vary over time, from their first to last purchase?
- How can we segment users into cohorts based on their first and last purchase months?
- What insights can we derive from analyzing user cohorts in terms of their purchasing frequency and retention rates?
- How do retention rates vary across different cohorts and over time?


### Project Goal:
The project objective was to create a conversion funnel to understand how well the website is converting product page views into purchases, build acquisition cohorts based on the month of a userâ€™s first purchase to track cohort metrics month by month, and aggregate the purchase data into cohorts to calculate retention rates for each cohort month by month.

# Results:

### 1. The Total Conversion Rate (TCR) for purchases made is 36%, the TCR for users to shopping page stage is 29%, and the TCR for shopping page to purchase stage is 10%
### 2. The retention rate is higher for the first week of each month reflected by the cohort age column

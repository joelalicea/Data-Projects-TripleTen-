# Tableau - Storytelling with Data

# Saving Supertore - Analyzing the Root of Returns


## Description of the Project:
Our focus is on conducting an analysis to identify the reasons for the substantial volume of returned orders.


Through the analysis of diverse data dimensions, our objective is to address key questions:
- What is the correlation between total sales and total returns? Is there a consistent pattern where higher sales always result in higher returns?
- Which product categories have the highest return rates?
- Do specific customer segments demonstrate a higher propensity for making returns?
- Is there a geographic concentration of returned orders, and does the return rate vary by state?
- Do returned orders exhibit a seasonal pattern by month?
- What insights can we gather from return rates regarding state, year, and product category?

## Project Goal:
This project examines the significant volume of user returns, identifies potential underlying reasons for these returns, and provides suggestions and recommendations for enhancing sales growth.

### Tools and Libraries:
- Tableau: Utilize Tableau for data visualization and analysis.
